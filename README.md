# MagazineScraper
The NewsCrapper app captures the title, magazine link, summary, and image of magazines available on the New York Times Magazine section (https://www.nytimes.com/section/magazine).

## Technologies
npm packages: express, express-handlebars, mongoose, cheerio, axios, express-handlebars



#### Here's how the app works: 
From the home page of xxxxxxxxx.heroku.com, users have a message asking them to click on "Scrape New Magazines" to access the list of all the available magazines.
- From the "Home" or "Scrape New Magazines" page users can save magazines.
- From the "Saved New Magazines," users can add or edit note(s) related to the magazine, and also, have the option of removing it from the list. If there is not a saved magazine, a message will notify the user.
